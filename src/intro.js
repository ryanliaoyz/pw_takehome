                    I enjoyed almost everything about crafting: woodworking, distilling, music composing(including coding!) that making something of my own always grant me the satisfacation, until I almost poisoned myself with some homebrew, yet I still dream of a home lab.

                    I grew over thousands of pot of plants through my life course, and raised many pets. I was obssessed with collecting exotic plants beforeward but decide to stick to something more practical(ginger, scallion...) at this point. I have a cat and a lizard as companion now.
